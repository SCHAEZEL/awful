<h4>MEX helper</h4>
<p>The library also contains <a href="/wikipage?title=au_mex.h&amp;referringTitle=Documentation">au_mex.h</a>, a collection of C++ classes which greatly simplify mex file writing. </p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The au_ prefix is because it's important in matlab's flat namespace that clashes of function names are avoided.</p>
